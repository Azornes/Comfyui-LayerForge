        ## Additional Information (Optional)
        *The following fields help me debug complex issues but are not required for most bug reports.*
        ### üîç Enable Debug Logs (for **full** logs):
        
        #### 1. Edit `config.js` (Frontend Logs):
        Path:
        ```
        ComfyUI/custom_nodes/Comfyui-LayerForge/js/config.js
        ```
        Find:
        ```js
        export const LOG_LEVEL = 'NONE';
        ```
        Change to:
        ```js
        export const LOG_LEVEL = 'DEBUG';
        ```
        
        #### 2. Edit `config.py` (Backend Logs):
        Path:
        ```
        ComfyUI/custom_nodes/Comfyui-LayerForge/python/config.py
        ```
        Find:
        ```python
        LOG_LEVEL = 'NONE'
        ```
        Change to:
        ```python
        LOG_LEVEL = 'DEBUG'
        ```

        ‚û°Ô∏è **Restart ComfyUI** after applying these changes to activate full logging.
